#### About the project
It is a discord bot designed to help create and manage events, but most of all to remind people of the events they signed up for. It is written in TypeScript/JavaScript and uses the discord.js library.

#### How to use?
1. Ckeck, that ypu have **NodeJS** installed! For this, run `node -v`. If it prints out a version number, you're good. Else download the newest version of Node
2. Clone the repository to your preferred environment (like a folder on your PC)!
3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`!
4. Create a file named **".env"** in the project's root directory and add the variable `DISCORD_TOKEN = your_discord_bot_token`. Just replace the discord bot token with that of your bot!
5. Run the bot with `npm run start`!

##### Working with the code
If you intend to edit the project to either contribute or just for your own use, you can use the following commands:
- `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- `npm run start` to simply start the bot.
- `npm run refresh` to compile and instantly start the bot.
